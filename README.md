# MP 7: Webscraping With Python
Rittika Adhikari and Soham Saha

Webscraped Forever21 website using Python to extract information about dresses, tops, and bottoms. The information extracted was: category name, display name, whether it is a final sale, product ID, and list price. This extracted information was then consolidated into a csv. 

Then, we experiment with Machine Learning packages (such as sklearn) to build a classifier
that predicts what kind of category (dress, top, or bottom) a certain item should be, 
based on whether its a final sale, its product ID, and its listed price.
